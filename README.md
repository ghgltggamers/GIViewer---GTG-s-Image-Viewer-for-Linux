# GIViewer---GTG-s-Image-Viewer-for-Linux
A simple Image Viewer open source program written for linux users in C++ officially by ghgltggamer as a project for fun. This is also written mostly by chatGPT but the program was buggy so , @ghgltggamer has also written this you can say arounf 60% is chatGPT and rest of the 40% ghgltggamer. overall a nice app for beggners to learn

## Important message for you
Hey, This is ghgltggamer aka a gammer + programer who has created this project. I was trying gthumb but in my arch linux based laptop won't run it so i decided to write my own program , My plan was to start from scratch but it would be a lot time consuming so i used chatGPT to write the base the beleave me that was a buggy + full of errors base and then i corrected that base and wrote the rest of the part my self. So i hope that you will enjoy it.
