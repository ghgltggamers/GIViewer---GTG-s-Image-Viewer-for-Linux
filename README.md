# GIViewer---GTG-s-Image-Viewer-for-Linux
A simple Image Viewer open source program written for linux users in C++ officially by ghgltggamer as a project for fun. This is also written mostly by chatGPT but the program was buggy so , @ghgltggamer has also written this you can say arounf 60% is chatGPT and rest of the 40% ghgltggamer. overall a nice app for beggners to learn
